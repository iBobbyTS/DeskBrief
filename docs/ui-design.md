# UI Design

DeskBrief is a compact macOS menu bar utility. Its UI should feel like a focused desktop tool: dense enough for repeated use, visually quiet, and aligned with native macOS controls.

## Overall Direction

- Prefer native SwiftUI and AppKit-backed macOS controls before custom drawing.
- Keep settings, menu items, report views, and log views optimized for scanning rather than marketing-style presentation.
- Use system-adaptive colors and semantic foreground styles so Light and Dark mode remain readable.
- Use custom surfaces sparingly. Framed cards are appropriate for repeated settings rows, previews, list items, and dialogs, but page sections should not become nested cards.
- Use SF Symbols in buttons and menu-adjacent actions when a familiar symbol exists.

## Settings Layout

- `SettingsView` uses tabs for product areas: screenshot analysis, work content summary, and general. Report settings live at the bottom of the work content summary tab.
- Each tab uses a leading-aligned vertical layout with `Layout.sectionSpacing` between major sections.
- Section titles use `title2` semibold and should introduce the controls immediately below them.
- Group related settings inside one rounded settings surface with row dividers.
- Setting rows use a label on the left and the editable control aligned to the right.
- Pickers, text fields, and date pickers should use fixed or proportional widths so controls line up across rows.
- Rows inside a settings surface use shared horizontal and vertical padding constants.
- Dividers that separate major sections should have equal visual spacing above and below. If a section owns the divider, the content before it should include bottom spacing matching the parent section spacing after it.
- Do not add extra explanatory text inside settings unless the user needs a persistent warning, provider limitation, or validation message.
- API key persistence failures should be blocking and explicit: keep the affected field rolled back to the last saved value, log the failure, and show the localized `SettingsPersistenceAlert` instead of relying on inline text that could be missed. Existing Keychain API key data that cannot be decoded is also user-visible through settings errors instead of being silently treated as a saved empty key.
- Category-rule persistence failures follow the same pattern: keep the visible category list and analysis snapshot at the last saved value, log the database failure, and show a localized `SettingsPersistenceAlert`.
- The General tab includes a Language picker and a Database Settings section. The database encryption control uses the same switch style as other binary settings, with an info tooltip explaining plaintext/encrypted readability and that the key is stored in Apple Keychain for automatic database decryption at app launch. When encryption is enabled, the Change Database Key row shows a hidden input, Confirm button, and tooltip aligned to the right-side control column. The current key is never displayed in the app; only unsaved new input appears in the field.
- Closing Settings with an unsaved database-key input must present a confirmation dialog that keeps editing by default and offers a destructive "close without saving" path; the discard button must use AppKit destructive styling. Database encryption, decryption, and key changes use explicit confirmation dialogs rather than applying on toggle or field edit alone.
- The Open Database Location button sits outside the Database Settings surface, matching utility actions such as Test Screenshot, and opens Finder selecting the current `AppDatabase.databaseURL`.

## Screenshot Analysis Settings

- The capture section keeps the screenshot interval, screenshot storage location, automatic-analysis controls, and automatic screenshot deletion retention in one settings surface.
- A screenshot storage location picker sits directly below the screenshot interval row in the same capture settings surface. The picker offers two options: Disk (硬盘) and Memory (内存), and its control/tooltip use the same right-side alignment column as other setting rows. Its tooltip explains that disk storage persists screenshots across app restarts and is the default, while memory storage keeps screenshots only during the current process lifetime and discards them when the app exits, which may be preferred for privacy-sensitive environments.
- The automatic screenshot deletion retention picker (Off, 7 Days, 14 Days, 28 Days) sits as the last row in the screenshot capture settings surface, and its tooltip explains that only root JPEG files are affected.
- Analysis startup mode is the primary control for automatic startup behavior and should leave enough picker width for the longest localized option.
- Scheduled analysis time is only visible when the startup mode is scheduled analysis.
- The charger requirement is visible only when analysis can auto-start on hardware with an internal battery, and it does not apply to the manual Analyze Now action. Desktop Macs hide the row.
- Utility actions such as test screenshot and opening folders live below the settings surface, not inside it.
- The divider below the capture section should maintain the same vertical spacing above and below.
- Category rows expose a compact color control before the name field. The control should offer the built-in 16-color preset palette and use the native macOS color picker for custom colors.
- LM Studio memory-check labels and GiB units are visible UI strings and must come from `AppLocalization.swift`, even when the technical unit remains `GiB` in every supported language.
- Newly added categories choose their default color from the preset palette by excluding colors already used by all current categories, including the preserved Other row. If every preset is already in use, reuse is allowed but the app should avoid repeating the previous editable category's color.
- Category names, category descriptions, and summary instructions use soft character limits of 32, 200, and 500 characters. The app warns with red borders only after a value exceeds its limit; it does not truncate or block input. Description and summary editors show compact `current/limit` counters in the lower-right corner.
- The image-analysis method picker belongs only to screenshot analysis. Work content summary uses a text-only model profile and should not expose screenshot-specific analysis controls.
- The LM Studio-only lifecycle toggle sits directly below context length in both model tabs. Hovering that row should explain that the app can proactively load and unload the model before and after analysis, and the row should stay hidden for non-LM Studio providers.

## Menu Bar UI

- Menu bar labels should be short and scannable.
- Keep long runtime details in status lines or dedicated windows rather than long action labels.
- Mutating actions should use explicit menu items; state display should stay separate from commands.
- Keep first-level commands ordered as Current Status, Reports, Clear Early Screenshots, divider, Settings, Analysis startup mode, Show Logs, Analysis Runs, divider, then Quit.
- Nested menus are appropriate for compact first-level option groups such as analysis startup mode.
- The Current Status submenu should switch between an idle summary, a running screenshot-analysis block, or a running work-content-summary block. Screenshot analysis and work-content summary runs are mutually exclusive, so both running blocks should not appear together.
- During explicit LM Studio model loading, the model line should say `Loading model` instead of `Current model` for both screenshot analysis and work-content summary.
- `Analyze Now` becomes the stop action for the active run: `Stop Current Analysis` during screenshot analysis and `Stop Current Summary` during work-content summary. It should be disabled only while that stop request is already in progress. Backfill should be disabled while any run is active, using the run coordinator gate rather than only visible progress state so handoff windows cannot enable it briefly. The analysis startup mode submenu remains enabled during runs and only affects future triggers.
- When either model profile uses LM Studio, the Current Status submenu should expose a force-unload command for that specific profile as a third block after the status text and the regular action section. Keep `Open Screenshots Folder` and `Analyze Now` together in the second block.
- The Clear Early Screenshots submenu calculates counts asynchronously when opened. It should show calculating, empty, count, and failure states without blocking the menu bar UI, and destructive cleanup requires confirmation.

## System Notifications

- Background task notifications should be concise and outcome-focused.
- Manual Analyze Now completion reports analyzed screenshot counts. If daily reports were generated, include either the specific daily-report day or the number of generated daily reports.
- Manual backfill completion reports newly filled work-block summaries and daily reports.
- Scheduled and realtime automatic analysis should notify only when it generated at least one daily report or when the run failed or partially failed. Successful screenshot-only automatic runs stay silent.
- Realtime mode may also send a backlog warning if the pending screenshot count grows by at least five between five-minute checks. The warning should stay concise and should not change the run state.
- Partial failures and failed runs should direct the user to the log window instead of embedding detailed diagnostics in the notification body.
- Clicking analysis-completion notifications should open the most useful existing windows: successful runs open Reports, partial failures open Reports and Logs, and complete failures open Logs.

## Reports And Logs

- Reports should prioritize timeline and aggregate comprehension over decorative layout.
- Keep report responsibilities split by file: `ReportsView.swift` composes the window, `ReportsViewModel.swift` derives report state, `ReportLegendViews.swift` owns legend layout and hover geometry, and `ReportHeatmapViews.swift` owns timeline renderers.
- Day report labels show the localized date followed by `·` and the weekday name.
- The report range selector should hide day, week, month, or year options whose visible records are all derived Away time. Empty natural periods between real activity records should not appear in the left report list.
- Report charts and heatmaps should use the fixed colors saved on category rules instead of assigning colors from the current chart order.
- Report durations use one shared format across day, week, month, and year views: under 60 minutes uses minutes, 60 to 5,999 minutes uses hours and minutes, and 6,000 minutes or more uses whole hours.
- The report chart type row should use a separate leading title and a fixed-width segmented control so it aligns with the summary card above and the legend below.
- Heatmap legends are clickable category filter buttons rather than explicit checkboxes. Selected and unselected states are conveyed through opacity, with every category selected by default.
- Clicking a heatmap legend filters rows without clearing the category hover summary; category summaries should follow pointer hover state, not selection state, to avoid vertical layout jitter.
- Heatmap containers size to `min(content height, available height)`. When category rows overflow the available report area, keep the time/date axis pinned at the top of the rounded container and scroll only the row list.
- Category ordering should keep regular categories first, preserved Other second last, and Away last. Bar charts hide Away bars while keeping Away in the legend for color and filtering consistency.
- Weekly heatmap brightness uses one normalization pool for all selected non-away categories and a separate pool for Away.
- Daily heatmap blocks may represent merged contiguous work summaries even when the visual span matches the underlying raw events. Hover text appears only from `daily_work_block_summaries`, not directly from raw analysis rows, and is anchored next to the selected date in the right report header so the heatmap itself does not shift when hover content changes.
- Daily report legends keep category-summary hover stable across chip gaps by checking pointer locations against row-union hover rectangles with a small margin; individual chip exits should not clear the hovered category, and trailing empty space after the last row should not count as hovered.
- DeskBrief assumes a pointing device for the richest report experience. Category summaries and daily heatmap work-block summaries are intentionally hover-driven, so keyboard-only and VoiceOver paths can still navigate the app but are not considered equivalent report-summary interaction modes.
- Derived statuses such as temporary daily reports should be visually marked where the result appears, not explained in a detached help block.
- Runtime logs should remain dense, sortable or filterable when needed, and copy/export friendly.

## Analysis Runs

- The Analysis Runs window is opened from a dedicated menu item below Show Logs, maintaining menu bar consistency with the existing logs and reports entry points.
- The view uses a dense scrollable table (horizontal + vertical) with fixed-width columns so all columns remain readable at typical window sizes.
- Column order matches the data priority: time, model, status, success/failure, analysis duration, summary duration, analysis tokens, summary tokens, and error.
- Time cells use the app language's localized short date/time order instead of a hard-coded numeric pattern.
- Summary-related columns (summary duration, summary tokens) display linked `summary_runs` data when the summary run was triggered by that analysis run. If no summary run is linked, the cell shows an em dash (`—`).
- The Auto-Refresh behavior relies on `appDatabaseDidChange` notifications so the table stays current without polling.

## Localization

- All visible UI strings must go through `AppLocalization.swift`.
- When adding or changing UI copy, update both Chinese and English entries in the same change.
- Prefer concise labels that fit in existing row widths before increasing layout constants.

## Verification

- Run `DeskBriefTests` after UI changes that alter settings behavior, localization, or persisted preferences.
- For purely visual spacing changes, a build or the existing unit test suite is usually sufficient unless the change affects window flow, permissions, or menu behavior.
- Use GUI testing only when the interaction itself is under test; do not rely on it for simple spacing adjustments.
